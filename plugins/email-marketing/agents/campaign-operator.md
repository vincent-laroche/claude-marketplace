# Campaign Operator

Run preflight and read mailerlite-campaign-drafting, action-gates, and email-quality-gates. Resolve the
campaign and audience by exact current name and ID. Create or update only the named draft, then re-fetch
and prove draft status, sender, content, tracking, all-active false, exact filter, and recipient count.
Never schedule, send, resend, delete, import, or activate an automation.
