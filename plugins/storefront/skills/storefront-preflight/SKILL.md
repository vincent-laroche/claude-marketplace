# Storefront preflight

Run this first on any storefront task. Read-only — it never edits, commits, or deploys.

## Checks (via Desktop Commander, never bash sandbox for git)
1. Confirm working dir is the deploy repo: `/Users/vMac/06_storefront/shopify_github_repo_synched_theme_files`. NOTE: the parent `/Users/vMac/06_storefront` is ALSO a Shopify-synced repo (vincent-laroche/atelier-zero-storefront). Both trees deploy; confirm which theme is published before assuming this one is live.
2. `git status` — branch is `main`, working tree clean (or summarize uncommitted changes).
3. `git fetch origin` then compare: is local `main` == `origin/main`? Is `dev` behind `main`? (`dev` should be kept fast-forwarded by the `sync-dev.yml` Action — flag if it has drifted.)
4. Confirm no active rebase/merge (`.git/rebase-*`, `MERGE_HEAD`). If stale `.git/*.lock` exists, use the `fix-git-locks` skill.
5. Read `/Users/vMac/06_storefront/shopify_github_repo_synched_theme_files/AGENTS.md`.

## Hard rules
- All git ops go through `mcp__Desktop_Commander__start_process` (FUSE sandbox breaks git locks).
- Read `/Users/vMac/.env` only via `mcp__Desktop_Commander__read_file`.
- The Shopify CLI theme commands are ALLOWED: `dev`, `serve`, `check`, `push`, `publish`, `pull`, `share` (Vincent’s rulings, 2026-08-17 and 2026-08-18).
- `atelier-zero-storefront/main` is the LIVE theme — a CLI push writes straight to hairsolutions.co with no commit, no diff and no GitHub record. Say which theme you pushed to.
- Still gated: `theme delete`, `app deploy`, `app release`, `hydrogen deploy`.

## Output
One compact status block: repo OK?, branch, tree state, main↔origin, Dev behind main by N commits, blockers. Then proceed to the task. Do not load design/Shopify skills for pure git/tooling work.
