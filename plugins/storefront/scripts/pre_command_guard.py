"""PreToolUse(Bash) guard for the hairsolutions.co storefront.

The Shopify CLI theme commands are ALLOWED, including deploys. Vincent ruled
on this in two steps:

  2026-08-17 - `theme dev` / `theme serve` permitted: they render a local
               preview and publish nothing.
  2026-08-18 - `theme push` / `publish` / `pull` / `share` permitted too,
               with the live-theme consequence stated and accepted.

This guard previously blocked all of them, which silently overrode the
project's own permission set — plugin hooks run regardless of
.claude/settings.json — and made authorized commands unusable. Do not re-add
`dev`, `serve`, `push`, `publish` or `pull` here.

Note what `push` and `publish` now mean: `atelier-zero-storefront/main` is the
LIVE theme, so a CLI push writes straight to hairsolutions.co with no commit,
no diff and no GitHub record. Prefer the local repo -> GitHub path when the
change should be reviewable; use the CLI when speed matters more.

Still blocked, because neither is a deploy:
  - `theme delete`  destroys a theme irreversibly
  - `app deploy` / `app release` / `hydrogen deploy`  different product surface
  - raw `git push` in Bash  runs through Desktop Commander (FUSE breaks locks)
    and is a separate approval per .claude/rules/work-authorization.md

Exit 0 = allow. Exit 2 = block (stderr is shown to the model).
